# ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services) Documentation

## Overview

Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) is a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution developed by Microsoft. It provides users with authenticated access to applications and systems across organizational boundaries using a claims-based authentication model.

## Key Features

- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Seamless access to multiple applications with a single set of credentials.
- **Claims-Based Authentication:** Uses claims to communicate user identity and attributes.
- **Federation:** Supports secure identity sharing between trusted partners (federation partners).
- **Integration:** Works with Azure AD, Office 365, and other Microsoft or third-party services.

## Core Components

- **Federation Server:** Handles authentication requests and issues security tokens.
- **Federation Server Proxy:** Forwards requests from external users to the federation server.
- **ADFS Web Application Proxy:** Provides additional security for external access.
- **Active Directory:** Stores user identities and credentials.

## Typical Architecture

1. **User attempts to access a federated application.**
2. **Application redirects the user to ADFS for authentication.**
3. **ADFS authenticates the user against Active Directory.**
4. **ADFS issues a security token containing claims.**
5. **User is redirected back to the application with the token.**
6. **Application validates the token and grants access based on claims.**

## Use Cases

- Providing SSO for on-premises and cloud applications.
- Secure collaboration with external partners.
- Integrating legacy systems with modern authentication protocols (e.g., SAML, OAuth, WS-Federation).

## Configuration Steps (High-Level)

1. **Install ADFS Role:** Use Server Manager or PowerShell.
2. **Configure SSL Certificates:** Required for secure communications.
3. **Setup Federation Service:** Specify the federation service name (usually a domain name).
4. **Add Relying Party Trusts:** Register applications that will trust ADFS.
5. **Configure Claim Rules:** Define what claims are issued to each application.
6. **Test Federation and SSO:** Verify that authentication and access work as expected.

## Security Best Practices

- Use strong SSL certificates.
- Regularly update and patch ADFS servers.
- Limit external access using firewalls and proxies.
- Monitor and audit authentication logs.

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Failures:** Check certificates, claim rules, and federation trust settings.
- **Token Issues:** Validate claim issuance and token signing.
- **Connectivity Problems:** Ensure network access between ADFS, proxies, and Active Directory.
